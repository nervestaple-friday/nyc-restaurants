## About Jim
- Name: Jim
- Location: Brooklyn, NY (Kensington area)

- GitHub: nervestaple
- Gmail: nervestaple@gmail.com

## Preferences & Quirks
- "Tomorrow before bed" means **starting the next morning** (e.g., reminders)
- BlueChew/medication-related: call it **"medication"** in any summaries
- **Nextdoor**: useless, skip entirely
- **Financial statements**: skip unless something is abnormal
- **Film suggestions**: ALWAYS verify not already in Plex/Radarr library before suggesting
- Film taste: Wiseman docs, Claire Denis, Bakshi, Trier, Safdie, Hitchcock, international cinema, genre with real craft. **Ignore franchise/blockbuster films** (obvious).
- Daily suggestions: propose 1-2 films + 1 show per day for addition

## Active Projects

### jim.wtf (personal site)
- Repo: nervestaple/jim-wtf
- Stack: React Three Fiber + Next.js
- Current state: main page returns null (blank), has HeadFlow component (3D monograms), TorturePit/RagdollBody built but unwired
- PR #222 open: deps bump to latest (Next 16, React 19, R3F 9, etc.)
- **Creative vision**: starts as vintage 1997 HTML (GeoCities aesthetic), progressively corrupts/glitches as you navigate deeper, with 3D R3F effects bleeding through
- Reference site: nervestaple/jimandhallie-biz (wedding site, more modern patterns)
- Note: using --webpack flag (Turbopack doesn't support file-loader for .glb imports — separate PR needed)

### arr-proxy
- Deployed on Radarr machine (192.168.4.94)
- Docker compose, restart: unless-stopped
- Proxies both Radarr (/movies/*) and Sonarr (/series/*)
